# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this webpage is to allow users to filter for multiple criteria for documented UFO sightings. The webpage has a dynamic table that can be filtered by the object’s sighting date, city, state, country, and shape.

## How to filter through the sightings:

On the left side of the page, you will see a section with a heading that says, “Filter Search” and five criteria to search through the data.

Each search bar shows an example of how to write the filter for each criterion. For example, if I wanted to search for sightings in Oregon on 1/12/2010, I will write it like this:

Once you have your criteria written in the search bar(s), press enter. This will then alter the table on the right to give you your specific sightings, as shown in the above picture.

To restart your search for new sightings, click “UFO Sightings” in the above left corner.

## Summary

A drawback of this webpage’s filter design is that users might not know where to start searching or what the data has in store for them. To fix this problem, having a drop-down menu for each search criteria would be more helpful. For example, having each state that the data has for a UFO sighting. This data does not have every state for the US. This way, the user can see right away if their desired state, date, or city has been documented. 
Another recommendation for the webpage’s design is to have a button underneath the filter search that says, “restart filter”. This way, the user knows exactly where to click when they want to restart a search.
